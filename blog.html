            <p> Today, I arrived in Tokyo, Japan! I have been to Japan for many years and it will always be my favourite country.
            I woke up super early and caught an uber to the airport. I had a direct flight from Gold Coast Airport
            to Tokyo. I arrived there just after 6pm. It was a long flight and I usually don't like long flights. I was 
            really excited when I arrived in Japan. The first thing I always do when I arrive is to buy onigiri, which
            is like a rice ball filled with delicious fillings such as tuna and salmon roe.

        <h2> Day 2 - Shibuya </h2>
        <p>Published on 08-03-2021</p>
        <br>
        <p> Today is the second day of my trip in Japan. Shibuya has always been one of my
            favourite places to visit in Japan. It is known for the cross-intersection and the hachiko dog statue.
            There are quite a lot of things to do in Shibuya but it is popular for shopping and the department stores.
            Today, I will be shopping for some clothes and eating some delicious food! </p>

        <h2> Day 3 - Akihabara  </h2>
        <p>Published on 09-03-2021</p>
        <br>
        <p> Today is my third day of my Japan trip. I feel like time is going by so fast! I can't believe
            its my third day. Akihabara is a place I must always visit when I visit Japan. Even when I lived in Japan,
            I used to visit it at least once in a month. It is a place I love for its vibrant colours and the game crane machines.
            If you are an avid fan of anime and manga, it is a place you must visit. Akihabara is filled with lots of electronic shops 
            and sells anime goods, figures, manga and for the adventorous; maid cafes, which I have been to twice. It is an interesting experience. </p>

        <h2> Day 4 - Harajuku </h2>
        <p>Published on 10-03-2021</p>
        <br>
        <p> Harajuku! A place which is known for its fashion. Whenever you go there, you will always find people
            dressed in vibrant colours and also displaying their own personality through their clothes. </p>

        <h2> Day 5 - Ayase </h2>
        <p>Published on 11-03-2021</p>
        <br>
        <p> In 2017, I had the oppurtunity to study in Japan for a year at Akamonkai Japanese Language School.
            I lived in a place called Ayase, which is just a 40 minute train ride from Shinjuku. 
            So everytime I go back to Japan, I always visit Ayase. It is a place that will always hold dear to my
            heart and is like a second home to me . I would always visit the restaurants I visited during my time living
            there. I made good friends with one of the restaurant owners and I always visit him when I go to Japan.  </p>
